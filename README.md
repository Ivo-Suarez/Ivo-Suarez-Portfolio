# Ivo-Suarez-Portfolio

  ## A working platform for what will eventually become my professional website-portfolio

# Description

  ## This website is still very much incomplete. I've severely underestimated the time necessary to finish this week's assignemnt, and I understand if it cannot count toward any credit. Nonetheless, I've submitted what I have thus far, and intend to continue working on it as well as seriously revisiting lessons in css, as I feel I'm seriously lagging behind my peers.
